## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

**About Me**
Hi, I'm Nhick Alfred Antid, and I'm currently a student at PHINMA COC studying Human Computer Interaction, Information Technology.
My interest in Human-Computer Interaction stems from a frustrating experience with technology, a curiosity about how people interact with devices, a desire to make things more user-friendly. As an aspiring HCI professional, I'm particularly interested in understanding user needs, designing intuitive interfaces, exploring the impact of technology on people's lives.
Through my studies, I am currently learning about user research methods, basic prototyping techniques, the principles of usability, design thinking.
I am eager to apply these learnings and contribute to creating technology that is both effective and enjoyable for everyone.

My skills:

1. **User Interface (UI) Design**  
   - Creating visually appealing and functional interfaces that enhance user experience.  
   - Focus on layout, typography, color schemes, and overall design consistency.

2. **Usability Testing**  
   - Conducting tests with real users to identify pain points and areas for improvement.  
   - Iterating based on feedback to ensure the design is easy and intuitive to use.

3. **Wireframing & Prototyping**  
   - Designing low-fidelity wireframes to outline the structure and flow of the interface.  
   - Developing high-fidelity prototypes to simulate user interactions and refine design choices.

4. **Interaction Design**  
   - Focusing on how users interact with interfaces, ensuring intuitive and smooth navigation.  
   - Designing responsive elements like buttons, forms, and gestures.

5. **Human-Centered Design Principles**  
   - Applying principles that prioritize the needs, behaviors, and limitations of users throughout the design process.  
   - Ensuring designs are not just functional but also emotionally engaging.

6. **Cognitive Psychology for Design**  
   - Leveraging knowledge of how the human brain processes information to create designs that are easy to understand and use.  
   - Optimizing for user memory, attention, and decision-making processes.

7. **Data Analysis & User Research**  
   - Collecting and analyzing user data (qualitative and quantitative) to inform design decisions.  
   - Conducting surveys, interviews, and analyzing usage patterns to refine designs.

8. **Accessibility Design**  
   - Designing interfaces that are accessible to all users, including those with disabilities.  
   - Ensuring compliance with accessibility guidelines (WCAG) to create inclusive experiences.

9. **Front-End Development (HTML & CSS)**  
   - Translating design concepts into interactive, responsive websites using HTML and CSS.  
   - Ensuring designs are functional across devices and browsers.

10. **Problem-Solving & Critical Thinking**  
    - Identifying design challenges and creatively developing solutions.  
    - Applying logic and reasoning to enhance user experience and system efficiency.
